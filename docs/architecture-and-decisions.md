# Architecture and decisions

## Overview

```
tests/            → exercise domain rules and persistence
src/parking/
  domain.py       → ParkingPlace, User, Reservation, State + business rules
  repository.py   → SQLite persistence of reservations
```

The domain module has no I/O. The repository stores and loads reservations;
rule checks that need existing data (overlap) take the loaded reservations
as input. The Notification Service boundary will be a small interface in
the domain with a stub implementation (not in C01).

## Decisions

### D1 – Python, standard library only
Chosen over Java + Spring Boot because the whole team knows Python, nothing
has to be installed, and a clean checkout runs with one command. Cost: no
framework for the later HTTP layer; we will add one (FastAPI or Flask) when
the walking skeleton needs it.

### D2 – SQLite as the database
Zero configuration, file-based, ships with Python. Sufficient for CP1 and
for the expected load of a single car park. Revisit if the *Unknown* in the
Project Frame turns out badly.
